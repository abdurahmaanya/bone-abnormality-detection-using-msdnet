# bonde-abnormality detection from X-ray images using msdnet (multi-scale densenet).

The model was trained on MURA bone x-ray dataset provided by standford ml group. 

MURA dataset can be downloaded via https://drive.google.com/file/d/17tCQcpdSB26yh3dqA9Kz8fkgPQObFn9O/view?usp=sharing under the folder  MSDNet-PyTorch/MURA-v1.1

Thanks to https://github.com/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch for providing the pytorch implementation of msdnet.
